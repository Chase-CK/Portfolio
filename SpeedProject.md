# Speed Project

This game was built with ASP.NET. The basic Idea of the project was to build an asynchronous web app with Draggable, and droppable cards.
To accomplish the key features of this game We used the SignalR library for asynchronous communication between browser instances, and Blazor components for Draggable and droppable cards.
