# Weber State University Scholarship Application


## Objective

Weber State University's Scholarship web application needed the following changes
- To update from ASP.NET 2.0 to ASP.NET 6.0
- To do minor bug fixing
- To have the database automatically build for easier migration 

My group Was tasked to take on these objectives
  

## Execution 

We were given two weeks to make the given changes and met our deadline. The following was how we tackled this challenge.
We decided to take on the update to ASP.NET 6.0 first. We were able to accomplish this objective quite easily with help from Microsoft documentation.
We moved on to the minor bug fixing which as usual unveils more bugs to be fixed. I took on this role and found the areas of logic that were the source of the issues and I was able to solve and patch the main issues. We made documentation for the minor bugs that still needed work for the next developers to work on the code base. The automatic database migration was handled using .NET Entity Framework Core. The code was rebased to handle the changes to Entity Framework.
